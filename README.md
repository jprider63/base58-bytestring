Base58 encoding and decoding
============================

This Haskell library provides base58 encoding and decoding. 
This functionality was initially implemented by Philippe Laprade in the [haskoin](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskoin) package and released under public domain. 
This library simply pulls out the base58 encoding and decoding functionality for the haskoin package.
